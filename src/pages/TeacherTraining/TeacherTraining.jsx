          Yoga teacher training is a transformative journey that deepens your
          personal practice and equips you to guide others on their path to
          wellness. As a passionate 500-hour yoga teacher, holistic
          nutritionist, and wellness coach, my mission is to share these
          life-changing practices, empowering others to cultivate mindfulness,
          better health, and purpose.

          As a Yoga Therapist C-AIYT candidate, I offer personalized sessions
          tailored to each individual's physical, mental, and emotional needs,
          incorporating specific postures, breathwork, mindfulness techniques,
          and therapeutic tools. My goal is to create a safe, trauma-informed
          space where students can explore the mind-body connection, discover
          balance, and find vitality in every aspect of life.
